Hi! My name is Kay and this is my first game of tic tac toe made with html, css and javascript!

I call it "tic tac ha!" since the winner of the game will be able to choose an animated gif and express their bragging rights! 

The game is designed with lowest mobile device screen resolution size for accessibility, referencing information on below link:

Hope you enjoy it and feel free to send any feedback to kreshna.sp@gmail.com
